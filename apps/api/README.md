# GitHub Repository Tracker API

This is the backend API for the GitHub Repository Tracker application. It's built with NestJS, GraphQL, TypeORM, and integrates with the GitHub API to track repository releases.

## Features

- GraphQL API to manage tracked repositories
- PostgreSQL database to store repository and release data
- Integration with GitHub API to fetch repository information and releases
- Scheduled tasks to periodically sync repository data
- Support for marking releases as seen/unseen

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL 
- GitHub Personal Access Token (for API access)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the API project with the following configuration:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_DATABASE=github_tracker

# GitHub API
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Data Sync Configuration
SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES=60
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## GraphQL API

Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:3000/graphql` to interact with the API.

### Queries

- `repositories`: Get all tracked repositories
- `repository(id: ID!)`: Get a specific repository by ID

### Mutations

- `trackRepository(owner: String!, name: String!)`: Add a repository to track
- `removeRepository(id: ID!)`: Remove a repository from tracking
- `syncRepository(id: ID!)`: Manually sync a repository's releases
- `markAllReleasesSeen(repositoryId: ID!)`: Mark all releases for a repository as seen
- `markReleaseSeen(releaseId: ID!)`: Mark a specific release as seen
- `syncAllRepositories`: Manually trigger a sync of all tracked repositories

## Database Schema

The application uses two main entities:

### Repository

Stores information about tracked GitHub repositories including:
- Basic repository info (name, owner, description)
- Stats (stars, forks, watchers, open issues)
- Timestamps (created, updated, last synced)
- Status flags (has unseen releases)

### Release

Stores information about repository releases:
- Version information (tag name, name)
- Content (body, HTML URL)
- Publication date
- Seen status
- Timestamps (created, updated)

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
